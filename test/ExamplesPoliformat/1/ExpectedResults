Note: correct


a03.c:
Expected: 
 29 int C(int x, int x)
 30 {
 31   return A(B(x,y),B(x,y));
 32 }
should throw an error
          
Our Compiler: Gives error messages, although not on the double definition

Expected: Error because, there is no main function
Our Compiler: Line 1: Function main does not exist!
